### Meet the Search Command

```text
Going to Union Station takes time,
but this time can be an advantage.
Use it right, and travelling time
will pay off.
```

`/time` - search for time forward
`?time` - search for time backwards
`n` - go to the next result
`N` - go to the previous result - it always goes in the opposite direction
`/<CR>` - will execute the last search forward
`?<CR>` - will execute the last search backwards
`gn/N` - enter visual mode with matching string
`*` - search for word under the cursor

Use the "Up" button to browse search history.
