N + `<C-o>` - is like the browser's back button, but here it's used for files
N + `<C-i>` - is like the browser's forward button
`H / M / L` - jump to top/middle/bottom screen
`gf` - jump to file under the cursor
`<C-]>` - jump to definition of the keyword

`:jumps` - will list all the different jump points
